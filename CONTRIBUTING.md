### Report Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Phone Number Validator. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@ragtag.org instead.**

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/ragtagopen/project-slug/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
  _If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one._

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved submitted a form, explain if you clicked the form's submit button or pressed enter inside one of the inputs?

- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Phone Number Validator) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Phone Number Validator?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Phone Number Validator? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/ragtagopen/project-slug/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue"+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/ragtagopen/project-slug/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"help wanted"+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

_Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have._

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.
